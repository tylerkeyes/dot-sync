# dot-sync

## synchronize your configuration files across machines

The goal of this tool is to make it simple to keep my development environment consistent across machines.
I often will update a configuration on one machine, then wish I had it an another.
This tool will allow marking certain files or directories, then pushing or pulling changes from a remote.
This remote will likely be a github repo / gist, or other centralized location.
There would still be the issue of forgetting to sync my changes, but having a single command should aid my laziness.
